To find if Password Authentication is allowed

```bash
sshd -T | grep passwordauthentication

passwordauthentication no

```

To find if SSH Key Authentication is allowed

```bash
sshd -T | grep pubkeyauthentication

pubkeyauthentication yes

```

```bash
PasswordAuthentication yes

```

**Change this line to yes**

```bash
KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes

```

**Restart SSH service**

sudo systemctl restart ssh

```

> **TEST:** Create a user called test and login with password

```bash
adduser test
